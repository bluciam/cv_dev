My CV with a developer profile written in XeLaTex. Before compiling you have to install the software.

There is a `Makefile` to facilitate the creation of the `pdf` file. To create just run `make` and to clean the repository from created files run `make clean`. The result can be found in `en/enAll.pdf`. The infrastructure is there for a future translation.
