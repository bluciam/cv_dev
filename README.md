# cv_dev

This is my CV with a developer profile written in XeLaTex. A precompiled
version of the CV is found in `en/enAll.pdf`. To compile you would need to
install XeLaTex and its gazillion dependencies. 

There is a `Makefile` for the actual compilation and creation of the `pdf`
file. To create just run `make` and to clean the repository from created
files run `make clean`. The result can be found in `en/enAll.pdf`.

Il y a aussi une traduction français, et le résultat se trouve en
`fr/frAll.pdf`.
